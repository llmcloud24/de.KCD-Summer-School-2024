Summary
Zoom Usage and Technical Assistance Discussion

Sebastian discussed the potential use of Zoom for their meetings, expressing his preference for it due to its widespread use and reliability. He also mentioned the possibility of switching back to Teams if any issues arise. Sebastian also mentioned the need for feedback, which he had sent via email and was sharing in the chat. There was a technical issue with downloading data from Zoom, which was resolved. The team also discussed the need for assistance with certain steps, with Tauseef confirming he was logged into his Gpu machine. Felix and Max also participated in the discussion.

AI Development, Permissions, and Breakout Rooms

Sebastian guided Felix on creating a new machine, emphasizing using the correct key file. Felix faced a Windows permissions issue which Max offered to resolve. Sebastian suggested breakout rooms for longer discussions. Tauseef shared his Windows configuration. Max emphasized read permissions on key files. Heinig and Sebastian discussed using the same jump host. Sebastian proposed introducing modern machine learning and transformers, which the team agreed to. He discussed the current AI development phase being spring-like for transformers, with surging publications and commercial interest in large language models. Sebastian explained AI's cyclic development driven by innovations, touching on the "hype cycle" and potential for another "AI winter".

Exploring Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Neural Networks

Sebastian explained the fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), with ML being a subdiscipline of AI focused on algorithms that can learn from data. He introduced neural networks, particularly the multi-layer perceptron, and the importance of labeled data and backpropagation for training these models. Sebastian used an example to illustrate how a neural network's accuracy improves as it learns from labeled data. He discussed architectural advancements like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition and attention mechanisms for language models, explaining how CNNs use kernels to process images and attention maps to visualize the model's focus. Sebastian mentioned the breakthrough "Attention is all you need" paper and its application to language models.

Discussing Tools and Workflows for Efficiency

Sebastian discussed the installation of MiniForge and Conda, which are essential for creating environments. He also introduced Warp, a terminal replacement for Mac users. The team discussed the use of corporate models like OpenAI's GPT for better performance and robust responses. Sebastian explained the basic workflow of using APIs of vendors for deployment, which is considered easier and more cost-effective. He also mentioned the use of Docker Compose for setting up services and the connection to Alama for inference. The team agreed to focus on the terminal for their work.

Exploring Language Models' Potential and Limitations

Sebastian discusses the potential and limitations of using language models like GPT-2 and Llama 3.1. He suggests advanced users could deploy GPT-2 via a more elaborate package, but notes its responses often lack conversational quality. Max shares his experience with GPT-2 repeating itself or getting confused. Sebastian likens GPT-2's behavior to a "stochastic parrot." He highlights that while language models can be useful for personal tasks, they are not ideal for learning or replicating skills, citing a study on their limitations for software development. Sebastian encourages the team to explore the theoretical and practical aspects of language models further through empirical back-and-forth.

Discussing GPT-2, Conda, and Model Efficiency

Jay, Sebastian, and Vladimir discussed the use of Olama GPT 2 and the importance of the control D command. Sebastian explained the use of Conda and virtual environments for managing different projects and avoiding package conflicts. They also discussed the limitations of their current model, GPT-2, due to its size and memory usage, and explored the possibility of using newer models. Sebastian suggested trying different models empirically to find one that fits and mentioned the possibility of reducing the precision of the model's parameters for efficiency. He also mentioned a living benchmark where they run tests across all models.

Exploring Llama Model Architecture and Syntax

Sebastian discussed the architecture of the Llama model, explaining that it operates on tokens rather than words and has a context length of 132,000 tokens. He also explained the concept of embedding length, which is related to the hidden layers in the model. Vladimir asked about the syntax shown in the documentation for some models, to which Sebastian clarified that it is a way to specify roles such as user, assistant, and system. He also mentioned that the deployment software usually takes care of these roles. Sebastian further explained that the system prompt can be used for more power and expressiveness in working with LLMs, but it is more low-level.

Pre-Trained Models and Customization Challenges

Jay asked about the feasibility of using pre-trained models for specific contexts, such as a Wikipedia website in PDF form. Sebastian explained that it's not possible to instruct these models to disregard their internal information, as this would hinder their ability to communicate. He mentioned that there are ongoing research efforts to understand the trade-off between external information and internal knowledge of the model. Tauseef suggested the possibility of creating a custom model based on an existing one, but Sebastian clarified that this would be costly and difficult, as the models are already large and complex. He also mentioned that OpenAI has mechanisms to make their models more tunable and has a fine-tuning API. The team decided to allow more time for practice and exploration before the lunch break.

SSH Connection Issues and LLM Discussion

The team discussed issues related to their SSH connection and the installation of a conda. Sebastian suggested that the team should exit out of the shell and reconnect to ensure the new software is recognized. The team also discussed the concept of 'open washing' in the context of LLMs, with Sebastian explaining that many companies claim to be open source but are not. He suggested that this is a business strategy to differentiate themselves from OpenAI. The team also briefly touched on the differences between various LLMs, with Sebastian noting that each has its own unique character.

Model Differences and Applications in Medical Data

Felix and Sebastian discussed the differences between GPT-2 and Llama 3.1, attributing the variations to the size and complexity of the models. Felix questioned the applicability of these models to medical data sets, specifically protein and DNA sequences. Sebastian confirmed that while these models could be used for prediction, they would need to be trained on the specific data set to be effective. Jay and Sebastian discussed the accuracy and practical applications of converting images to text using models. Sebastian shared a project with Embo, a scientific publishing company, where they combined text and figure captions from scientific papers. They conducted a benchmark using GPT, which achieved a 99.5% accuracy rate in determining whether a caption belonged to an image. Sebastian suggested that these models could be applied in other ways, despite not being trained for that purpose.

Zoom Features and Breakout Room Issues

Sebastian clarified certain Zoom features were expected system behavior. Miranda and Vladimir encountered space issues, with Vladimir's related to running a larger model. Tauseef suggested Sebastian make him host to better manage the meeting. Sebastian attempted enabling breakout rooms and waiting rooms but faced difficulties. The team agreed to meet again in Teams to resolve these issues and test the breakout room feature.
