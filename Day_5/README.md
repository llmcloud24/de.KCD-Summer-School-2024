## Final Infos

Dear participants,

it was a pleasure working with you this week. After going through a full life-cycle of LLM deployment in the cloud together, here are some last info for you to take you on your own journey of LLMs in the cloud:

*	Feedback – We are interested to hear from you! It would be great if you could take 5 minutes to fill out the de.NBI survey about your experience at our summer school https://de.surveymonkey.com/r/denbi-course?sc=hdhub&id=000412

*	Github – Everything will be uploaded to the de.KCD Summer School 2024 repository on github and set to public, so you will still be able to access the material from this week. There is also a discussion function that we invite you to use to ask your questions.  

*	de.NBI cloud – We will have to close down our LLMcloud24 project after the summer school. However you can apply for your own research project at the de.NBI cloud (Please see here for more info: https://cloud.denbi.de/wiki/portal/allocation/).

*	de.KCD – If we have raised your interest in the de.KCD project, we invite you to get in touch at info@datenkompetenz.cloud. For those of you providing cloud services and/or are part of a NFDI, we also encourage you to fill out our needs assessment survey for future assistance.

*	TESS – Upcoming workshops and teaching materials from the life science data infrastructure community can be found on https://tess.elixir-europe.org/. We will also announce our future trainings over this website. Stay tuned!

*	Certificate of attendance: We are happy to provide you with a certificate of your attendance for our summer school detailing the content of the week. If you would like to have one, please email me your name and I will get back to you within a week.

If you have any other questions to ask or feedback to share, please feel free to email me : lisa.schaak@bih-charite.de.

We hope you have a relaxing weekend – you sure deserve it after this fully packed week – and wish you all the best for your future projects in artificial intelligence and cloud environment!

Best regards and maybe see you again,  
Lisa for the [de.KCD / BIH organizing committee](https://llmcloud24.github.io/contact.html)
