### Challenge for Advanced Users

By now, you are able to deploy and run different kinds of services, like Ollama and Pole for example.

Now you can apply everything you've learned and experienced, and try to accomplish these challenges:

- [ ] Automated backups of not only the data, but the services too
  - [ ] Bonus: versioning
  - [ ] Bonus: encryption
- [ ] Automated validation and testing of these backups
- [ ] Automated restoration of these services, along with the data
- [ ] Monitoring for all these steps
  - [ ] Bonus: active monitoring with alerts and notifications
- [ ] Bonus: isolate these steps to happen independently and not in the same VMs
- [ ] Ultimate bonus: completely automate the whole VM and resources creation + services deployment + backups/restores/monitoring
