## Data protection
This topic addresses the secure handling of personal and sensitive data, including adherence to privacy laws - most prominently the EU-GDPR. 
### Learning goals
Understand foundational principles of data protection, focusing on best practices for managing personally identifiable information and sensitive data, and ensuring compliance with national and international data privacy regulations.
### Key issues
+ Ethical and legal frameworks for the use of personal data: EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, WMA Declaration of Helsinki, EU-GDPR, EU Medical Device Regulation
+ Basic methods: pseudonomyzation, anonomyzation, minimization
+ Advanced aspects: data processing for statistical purposes, disclosure, data leaks, privacy tests, differential privacy
### Questions
+ How can researchers ensure the protection of sensitive data when working with diverse legal frameworks across different regions?
+ What are the key differences between pseudonymization and anonymization, and when should each be applied to ensure data privacy?
+ How should researchers handle data disclosure to third parties, and what precautions must be in place to protect privacy?
