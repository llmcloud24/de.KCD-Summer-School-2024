## Data ethics
This topic provides the ethical frameworks and values needed to guide responsible data use, minimizing bias and preventing unintended harm. 
### Learning goals
Understand the potential shortcomings of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as bias, hallucinations, and lack of explainability, and carefully design research questions, study protocols, and training data selection while considering the risks and interests of all stakeholders.
### Key issues
+ identifying and prioritizing ethical concerns
+ different concepts of intelligence (human and artificial)
+ operational definition of AI
+ common ethical challenges of AI: bias, hallucinations, lack of explainability
+ different ways of using AI in research
+ theories of morality and their application to AI contexts: virtue ethics, deontological ethics, utilitarianism
+ further influences: cultural differences, stakeholder interests, power differentials
+ conflicting values in using LLMs for research purposes
+ risk assessments and possible remedies
### Questions
+ What is your most pressing ethical concern regarding LLM usage?
+ How can researchers address issues like hallucinations, bias or lack of explainability in AI outputs, particularly in sensitive fields such as healthcare or public policy?
+ What conflicting values might arise when using LLMs for research, such as the tension between quality of service and privacy, and how can these be responsibly managed?
