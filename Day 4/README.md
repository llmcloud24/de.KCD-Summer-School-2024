  - [ ] create/using certs
  - [x] show an upptime example (of anything, like google.com etc)
  - [ ] show backup things: rsync, nfs share, cronjob
  - [ ] adding an auth layer/image (oauth2-proxy or something) on top of their existing apps from Day 3
  - [ ] show/make them do things via github repo
